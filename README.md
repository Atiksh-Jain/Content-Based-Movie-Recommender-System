🎬 Content-Based Movie Recommender System
This project is a personalized movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on their content features such as genres, keywords, cast, and overview. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and similarity measures to provide accurate and efficient movie recommendations.

Built with a real-time user interface using Streamlit, the application allows users to input a movie title and get top recommended movies instantly.

📌 Features
✅ Content-based filtering using metadata (overview, genres, cast, keywords)
✅ Text vectorization using CountVectorizer
✅ Similarity scoring using Cosine Similarity
✅ Real-time recommendations through Streamlit interface
✅ Fast and efficient retrieval with preprocessed and optimized data

🧠 How It Works
Combine important metadata into a single text feature.
Convert text into numerical vectors using CountVectorizer.
Compute similarity scores between movies using Cosine Similarity.
Return top N movies with highest similarity to the input movie.
